<h3>The Blackening</h3>

    <p>
    “We can’t all die first” is an excellent tagline perfectly fulfilled by Tim Story's "The Blackening," an ode to horror parodies like “Scary Movie.” This film’s comedy, characters, and commentary will be hilarious to all audiences but scratch a familiar itch among Black viewers. Of all of the film-watching customs within the Black community, shouting at and ridiculing horror movie characters for their ludicrous decision-making is integral, as is the expectation that we won’t see our people live until the end. It’s what inspired the title of Jordan Peele’s “Nope” and much of the “Scary Movie” franchise, but “The Blackening” takes nuggets of its predecessors and makes something entirely singular.
</p>
<p>
    Built on the 2018 Comedy Central short film by comedy trio 3Peat (of which co-writer Dewayne Perkins is a member), "The Blackening" follows a group of old college friends reuniting for a Juneteenth celebration at a cabin in the woods. After catching up and a few games of Spades, they find themselves in the clutches of a killer. With only their street smarts and knowledge of Black culture to get them through, what ensues is a riotous culture cry of a film. 
</p>
<p>  
    Central to their cat-and-mouse debacle is the film’s titular board game, The Blackening (which features a racist Sambo in its center), which everyone must play to survive. If they can answer its questions—such as how many seasons “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” had a dark skin Aunt Viv or name five Black actors who guest starred on “Friends”—they’ll be granted a few extra minutes of survival. But once the questions run out, the movie turns to full-fledged slasher territory.
</p>
<p>   
    From a “Scream”-esque cold open to a televised game master reminiscent of “Saw,” “The Blackening” wears its horror influences on its sleeve. The script (co-written by Perkins and Tracy Oliver of “Girl’s Trip”) is beyond hysterical, jam-packed with punchlines and wordless moments of physical comedy alike. Violence is played here more for laughs than scares, but there’s certainly bloodshed to be had amidst tense chase scenes and brawny faceoffs.
</p>
<p>   
    The cast has incredible chemistry that motivates not only the movie's fear but its comedy as well. There’s not a weak link to be found, but Dewayne (Dewayne Perkins), the gay best friend of the film’s most central character, Lisa (Antoinette Robertson), is consistently its humor and heart. Upon discovering that Lisa is hooking up with her serially unfaithful college ex, Nnamdi (Sinqua Walls), Dewayne is angry and defensive but hurt. This triangle of distrust creates a secondary plot, contributing not only empathetic beats about friendship and redemption but plenty of uproarious moments between the trio. Throughout, Robertson and Walls have true romantic harmony.
</p>
<p>   
    Even as "The Blackening" hones in on its relationship vs. friendship dilemma, the rest of the ensemble refuses to be ignored. From the absolute absurdity of Clifton (Jermaine Fowler), the awkward, Android-truther “Carlton” of the group who reveals his support for Trump, to the rambunctious, no-bullshit Shanika (X Mayo), “The Blackening” leaves no comedic stone unturned. Melvin Gregg shines as King, Nnamdi’s nonchalant ex-gangster best friend, and Grace Byers, as Allison, creates laugh-out-loud physical comedy while on an accidental Adderall trip. As the only biracial friend in the group, Allison is both the subject and emcee of the film's jokes about the spectrum of Blackness. 
</p>
<p>  
    Given the script's seamless hilarity, it can be easy to glide over all of the subtext within. But through character conversations and the thesis of the Blackening game, the movie sharply examines the role of Black people in horror, media, and culture. Characters are playing the game and fighting for their lives, but underneath, “The Blackening” points a finger at the ways Blackness is defined by a rubric and the litany of ways to have your card revoked. 
</p>
<p>   
    It’s all in lighthearted fun to strip Blackness because of not seeing “Friday,” and Story acknowledges this. However, "The Blackening" also directs a cutting gaze at a reality that in a world where white people incessantly seek to define Blackness, intra-community judgment and jokes can be harmful to people who haven’t had the privilege to be tapped into their culture until later in life. And while Story's movie certainly doesn’t contain the profundity of modern Black horror masterpieces like “Get Out,” it isn’t meant to. 
</p>
<p>   
    “The Blackening” is an unapologetically Black comedy through and through. It maintains its wit and bite to the very end, boastfully serving audiences a hilarious film we didn’t know we needed.

<h3>Extraction 2</h3>
<p>
Overseen and conceived by the Russo Brothers of Marvel fame, the "Extraction" films are an example of a dwindling breed: the big-budget, super-violent adventure. Whether the main character is named John Rambo, Jason Bourne or John Wick, he's a variant on a type: the prolific killer who'd prefer not to kill anymore but keeps getting pushed back into it. He has a tragic past and is grieving over it. And he's played by a guy who's so ferocious in violent scenes that you'd believe that he could take 100 blows to the head, face, and torso, plus a gunshot, a knife wound, and a grenade concussion, and keep going.
</p>
 <p>
    Critic Robert Brian Taylor calls these movies part of "The Sad Action Hero canon." Chris Hemsworth is its most notable new member. He plays Tyler Rake—a young boy's idea for an action hero name, but Hemsworth makes him seem almost like a real person. He's a tremendous physical actor, possibly as good as Schwarzenegger and Stallone in their primes, but with more range. He's played a scheming male bimbo, a legendary computer hacker, a depressed mercenary, a 19th-century whaler, a cult leader, and the mighty Thor, all convincingly. He's got a bit of the young Sean Connery's self-aware swagger as well. But there's also a buried sadness to him, and that's what the "Extraction" films dig out.
</p>
<p>
    Tyler used to be a special forces soldier with the Australian Army. He chose to go to Afghanistan for yet another tour of duty while his son was battling an incurable disease and was not present when the boy died. Then his marriage fell apart and he became a mercenary. Guilt over husbandly and parental failure is as much of a driving force in the "Extraction" franchise as amnesia in the "Bourne" films and mourning in the "John Wick" series. Tyler's adventures are redemption stories, set in action movie purgatories filled with shadow versions of the hero: defective fathers who mistreat, neglect, or warp their children and see them as extensions of their ego or brand. Tyler's main enemies are dark parents who could be stand-ins for Tyler's own masochistic feelings about how badly he failed his family.
</p>  
<p>
    The first "Extraction" showed Tyler rescuing the kidnapped son of an Indian drug lord who was being held in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The kid was a pawn in a pissing match between rich bullies with private armies. In accepting the mission Tyler sort of offered himself up a a karmic punching bag, absorbing punishment for his past mistakes in an urban hellhole-purgatory (in the original graphic novel, the setting was Paraguay) while serving as a quasi-father figure to the boy he was protecting. In this one, an unnamed man (Idris Elba, so charming that one hopes he'll be in the third one) shows up at the cabin in the woods where Tyler is recovering from the previous mission and delivers a message from his ex-wife, who, as it turns out is Georgian. Her sister and her children are being held in a Georgian prison by her drug dealer husband Davit (Tornike Bziava), who had the clout to get them all ensconced with him. Rake is hired to bust the family out of prison and take them away from Davit and his brother Zurab (Tornike Gogrichiani), who's even more of a psycho. Complications ensue. All you need to know is that the film is three long action sequences with a bit of character development sprinkled in.
</p>
<p> 
    The first is an uninterrupted 21-minute action sequence following Tyler and the family through a wild prison break and onto a train that's chased across the tundra by helicopters filled with armed thugs in body armor. Any thugs who aren't killed in midair drop onto the train and fight Tyler and his two allies, Nik (Golshifteh Farahani) and Yaz (Adam Bessa), with guns, fists, knives, and whatever objects are lying around. Director Sam Hargrave, a former stunt coordinator who made his directorial debut on the first "Extraction," takes the digitally-stitched-together, super-long "oner" that was introduced to viewers in mid-aughts films like Steven Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" and Alfonso Cuarón's "Children of Men" and pushes it to ostentatious but admittedly dazzling extremes.
</p> 
<p>
    Like the long take in the original "Extraction," it has a video game feeling. Cinematographer Greg Baldi's camera often adopts a first-person or over-the-shoulder vantage point, as in a "shooter" game. The point-of-view moves in and out of moving train cars, varies its distance to get tight closeups of people's anguished faces or panoramas full of moving vehicles and people, and generally does things that are against the laws of physics as well as the rules of production insurance companies. Despite the Eastern European blue-gray filters and bloodletting and bone-crunching, you're aware that that the sequence is no more "real" than the Avengers battling Thanos. Some composited landscapes and helicopters don't pass the believability test, and a few big camera moves that take us from outside to inside and vice-versa are too clever for their own good. But it's all so intricate and expertly timed that you still appreciate it, as one might a performance of a fiendishly difficult piano concerto where just hitting the notes is beyond most players' capabilities.
</p>
<p> 
    The other two major sections of the film are modeled, respectively, on the first "Die Hard" and one of John Woo's classic doppelgängers-battle-each-other films (probably "The Killer," which like this film, climaxes in a candlelit church with doves fluttering about). They're imaginatively conceived and executed with no-fuss virtuosity, though the cutting is sometimes too frenetic and the camerawork too wobbly (a lot of the time, Hargrave is doing a modified version of that Russo Bros' "shaky equals excitement" style). But they face the unusual problem of being good enough to anchor nearly any other action epic yet feeling like a letdown because they must follow that jailbreak-to-railway sequence. 
</p>
<p>    
    There's also a subplot about one of the ex-sister-in-law's kids, Sandro (Andro Japaridze), who has been trained from birth to be a gangster just like his dad and uncle, supposedly being torn between recognizing his family's multigenerational legacy of violence and brainwashing and choosing to go in a different directon, or taking up arms against the hero to get payback for Tyler killing one of his loved ones during the jailbreak. Anybody who's seen a Sad Action Hero movie knows how this part of the story will turn out—they're not going to write out Chris Hemsworth—so you play the waiting game.
</p>
<p>     
    Hemsworth and everyone playing characters connected to Tyler's past mistakes and present-day issues are thoughtful actors. They take this assignment seriously. They dig into the psychological trauma and guilt aspects of Joe Russo's script, imbue them with a "graphic novel" variant of seriousness (i.e., pulp fiction played solemnly), and briefly elevate "Extraction 2" beyond glorified video game status. But there's not enough dramatic substance, either in the writing or the marketplace-capped amount of screen time, to satisfyingly flesh out Tyler and his immediate circle. The film is single-mindedly focused on giving viewers more and more and more bang-bang. It wants to be a John le Carré novel and a cinematic equivalent of a shooter game at the same time. The first "Extraction" nearly pulled it off in scenes where Tyler bonded with an old merc buddy played by David Harbour, who was even more cynical than Tyler and turned out to be untrustworthy. It gets close again here in a scene where Tyler faces his deepest regrets directly in conversation rather than by encountering them as metaphors when he's on the job. But for the most part, the series hedges its bets to appeal to what it apparently considers its main audience: viewers who deem anything related to characterization and atmosphere to be "filler."
</p>
<p>     
    Still, you might appreciate the series' attempts to anchor military-adjacent shoot-'em-up adventures in something like reality, and give all of its major characters situations to play that are a step above the standard action film tropes. Where most contemporary Hollywood movies are aimed at the child in every grownup, the "Extraction" films speak to the potential grownup in every kid. Although it's rated "R," its ideal audience might be 12. The scenes between parents and their disappointed offspring capture that feeling you have when you're young and suddenly realize that the adults you once revered are human beings who can fail you and are often faking it.

<h3>Stan Lee</h3>
    <p> 
    I remember my first Marvel comic. I was a teenage fan of DC Comics’ Superman, who seemed to me to be the ideal superhero with an unquestioning dedication to “truth, justice, and the American way.” He was ever-stalwart, cheerful, and delightfully under-appreciated in his Clark Kent persona. And then someone gave me Marvel’s Fantastic Four. Here were superheroes who lived not in the made-up Metropolis but in real-life New York City. Their stories featured three elements I had never seen before in a comic: subversive humor, a slangy catchphrase (“It’s clobberin’ time!”), and ... bickering. These characters had cool superpowers, but they worried and were unsure of themselves and made mistakes. They had lives and personalities that felt real. 
</p>
<p> 
    I never lost my love for Superman, but I was thrilled by this new world that felt deliciously subversive and somehow accessible. I won’t say our son Ben was named after the Fantastic Four’s Ben Grimm, but I won’t say he wasn’t.
</p>
<p>    
    Fantastic Four. X-Men. Spider-Man. Thor. Black Panther. Iron Man. The Hulk. They are all part of the world created by Stan Lee, who was a teenager when he became an office boy and then a writer and editor for what would become Marvel Comics. In this documentary by David Gelb, Lee tells his own story and, through it, the story of how comics reflected and shaped their times from the 1940s to the present day, when movie special effects finally caught up with comic books’ ability to depict any fantasy setting. But Lee might say, the way he shaped the era. Lee was never shy about taking credit; in a way, his superpower was his ego.
</p>
<p>    
    The real-life audio and visual images are well-chosen, though the stories are unlikely to surprise anyone who has ever collected comics or attended a Con. And for a movie about a medium that is all about conveying action with eye-popping images of super-punches and flying through skyscrapers on spider webs, the archival footage oddly alternates with static, doll-house-like re-creations of people and settings, more suitable for “Severance” opening credits than a story about superheroes. 
</p>
<p>    
    As noted, Lee was not shy about telling his story (emphasis on his). In his final years, he served as an ambassador for Marvel, speaking at colleges and cons, going on any talk show that would have him, and providing cameos in blockbuster films. Lee was, above all, a storyteller. He always did a great job of making what he did at Marvel seem impressive, important, and fun.
</p>
<p>    
    Perhaps it was because he was a teenager when he started writing comics that he remained so connected to what young people needed in stories. “Our superheroes are the kind of people that you or I would be if we had a superpower,” he said. It was his idea to create a teenage superhero who would have teenage problems. Turned down by a boss who insisted that no one wanted to read about an adolescent superhero, Lee and artist Steve Ditko snuck it into what was supposed to be the final issue of a series called Amazing Fantasy. (“No one cares what’s in the final issue of a series that is being canceled.”) Lee says he got the idea for Spidey’s powers from watching a fly. Wouldn’t it be great to have superhero powers inspired by an insect’s strength and its ability to crawl on walls and produce a web? Later, he imagined a team of teenage superheroes in the X-Men. 
</p>
<p>    
    Lee says he always knew he was going to become somebody important. But at first, he did not think of comics as important. He “saved” his real name, Stanley Martin Lieber, for the serious writing he planned to do someday. Later, he learned to think of comic books as having an important role to play. During WWII, Lee served in the army, and one of his assignments was to find a way to reduce the training time for the soldiers processing payroll. He reduced it from six months to six weeks by conveying the information in the format he understood best—comics. 
</p>
<p>    
    From that, he learned, “You can convey a story faster, more clearly, and more enjoyably than any other way short of motion pictures.” Later, he learned the value of writing that was purely entertaining. And finally, yes, he learned that with great power comes great responsibility. He could have an influence on his readers and make them more inclusive. One of the film’s most fascinating moments begins with a letter from the government asking him to put an anti-drug story in a comic. He wrote a three-part story that included a cautionary tale about a friend of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The Comics Code Authority refused to authorize it because they forbade any mention of drugs. Lee and publisher Martin Goodman published it anyway.
</p>
<p>    
    The documentary also includes a testy exchange from a radio show between Stan Lee and his long-time partner, the legendary comic artist Jack Kirby, about who should get credit for creating the characters. There is a strong implication that Ditko left Marvel for the same reason. 
</p>
<p>    
    Lee bragged about creating superheroes with flaws. He was less willing to admit his own: “It’s an impossible task, and I don’t know how I managed,” is a typical not-so-humblebrag. But Lee's irrepressible joi de vivre and his recollections of the wild days shifting from story-first to pictures-first and fill-in-the-story-later are as much fun as he would have hoped. They might even leave you humming the Merry Marvel Marching Society song, or shouting, "Excelsior!"
